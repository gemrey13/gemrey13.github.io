            Volleyball is more than just a sport for me‚Äîit's a passion that
            keeps me active, focused, and connected. I play middle blocker for
            the BSIT Golden Huskies at Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena, where
            I've learned the value of timing, teamwork, and hustle. Recently,
            our team proudly won the championship, and the energy on the court
            was unforgettable.

              <li>Team chemistry on and off the court</li>
              <li>That feeling after a hard-fought win</li>
