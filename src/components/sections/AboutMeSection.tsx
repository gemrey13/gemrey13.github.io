            I'm a <span className="font-bold">full-stack web developer</span>,
            focused on building responsive and user-friendly applications. I
            started with a love for coding and grew curious about how tech
            solves real-world problems. That curiosity led me to explore both
            frontend and backend development, where I found my passion for
            building efficient and scalable systems.

            I see myself as a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">developer-leader hybrid</span>. I
            founded a student organization that trains others in tech and event
            support. I've also represented my region in national hackathons. I'm
            passionate about creating tools that make an impactâ€”and always eager
            to learn, grow, and build meaningful projects.

            My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in
            Information Technology from Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng Lucena, where
            I was recognized as the{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Most Promising IT Practitioner</span>.
            The experience allowed me to turn concepts learned in the comlabs
            into real technical skills, building a strong foundation in web
            development and problem-solving.
